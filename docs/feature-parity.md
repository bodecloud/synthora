# Feature parity matrix

Synthora is a clean-room synthesis of three projects (all MIT-licensed);
capabilities are reimplemented from their published architectures, not
vendored. Sources:

Status: ✅ implemented end-to-end · 🔶 partial · ⬜ explicit non-goal

## Local Deep Research (platform)

| Capability | Status | Synthora module |

| Background jobs + lifecycle + resume | ✅ | Redis + worker |
| REST API + cancel / report / events / delete / clear | ✅ | `apps/api` |

## Security & multi-tenancy hardening

Verified by `tests/test_isolation.py`.

| Capability | Status | Synthora module |
|---|---|---|
| Per-user workspace on register (session auth) | ✅ | `WorkspaceRepository.ensure_for_owner` + register endpoint |
| Workspace-scoped runs / sessions / documents / news (IDOR-safe) | ✅ | `NewsRepository.list_items` joins subscriptions + ANDs workspace filter |
| RAG `collection` engine scoped to caller workspace | ✅ | `adapters/workspace_context.py` contextvar; worker sets it per run |
| WebSocket auth (token query param or header; 4401/4403/4404 closes) | ✅ | `events_ws` in `apps/api/main.py`; web client appends `?token=` |
| MCP outbound SSRF guard (allowlist for remote hosts) | ✅ | `validate_mcp_url()` in `adapters/mcp_client.py` + `SYNTHORA_MCP_ALLOWLIST` |
| MCP inbound DNS rebinding protection (optional) | ✅ | `SYNTHORA_MCP_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION` + allowed host/origin lists on `/mcp` |
| Insecure secret-key boot refusal (session auth) | ✅ | `settings.assert_secure_for_auth()` at lifespan |
| Durable Postgres LangGraph checkpointer (cross-worker resume) | ✅ | `orchestration/checkpoint.py` + `psycopg[binary]`; compose default `SYNTHORA_CHECKPOINT_BACKEND=postgres`; smoke asserts `checkpoint_*` tables |

## Multi-pipeline requirement

| Pipeline | Status |
|---|---|
| `fast_research` | ✅ |
| `deep_research` | ✅ |
| `academic_research` | ✅ |
| `autonomous_research` | ✅ |

## Residual gaps (known)

Closed on ``feat/remaining-parity``: academic + autonomous API/worker E2E,
session create/delete UX, dynamic provider settings keys, workspace metrics.

Closed on ``feat/p0-parity-wiring``: outline consumes knowledge map;
``collection`` RAG embeds queries for cosine search; Tavily / Semantic Scholar /
SerpAPI / Mojeek resolve workspace provider settings; academic
``citation_verify`` drops rejected sources before section writing; key-required
engines without credentials are filtered and fail loud at run start.

Closed on ``feat/embed-upload-docs``: research-loop embeddings via
``resolve_research_embeddings`` (OpenAI → Ollama → hash), multipart document
upload (``.txt``/``.md``/``.pdf``/``.docx``), and architecture catalog sync.

Closed on ``feat/mcp-streamable-http``: official MCP streamable HTTP transport
at ``/mcp`` (same four tools as the REST shim), with shared execution in
``mcp_tools.py`` and session manager wired into the API lifespan.

Closed on ``feat/final-parity-surface``: SDK ``upload_document`` multipart
upload; MCP ``start_research`` accepts optional ``config`` on REST + streamable
tools; env-driven MCP DNS rebinding protection
(``SYNTHORA_MCP_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION``); web RunConfig exposes
``max_concurrent_research_units``, ``max_researcher_iterations``, and
``max_react_tool_calls``; SDK/MCP/isolation regression tests.

Closed on ``feat/sdk-api-completeness``: SDK ``download_export`` (authenticated
bytes), ``get_news_subscription``, ``search_documents(max_results=...)``,
``health``/``ready``; web client ``getNewsSubscription`` and search
``max_results``; streamable MCP workspace isolation test.

Closed on ``feat/export-and-web-parity``: full markdown export subset (fenced
code, blockquotes, ordered lists, tables, rules); PDF via fpdf2 ``write_html``
(preserves structure); web ``health``/``ready``/MCP REST wrappers; History
session drill-down via ``getSession``.

Closed on ``feat/mcp-async-hardening``: outbound MCP HTTP fallback fail-loud +
integration tests; ``AsyncSynthoraClient`` with ``iter_run_events`` WebSocket;
News subscription filter + ``getNewsSubscription`` UX; smoke validates export
formats and document upload.

Closed on ``feat/compose-embeddings-default``: compose defaults
``SYNTHORA_EMBEDDINGS=hash`` and empty ``OLLAMA_BASE_URL`` (no phantom Ollama
when profile disabled); sync ``SynthoraClient.iter_run_events``; embedding
default tests; parity audit doc sync.

Closed on ``feat/ollama-profile-and-async-ws``: ``docker-compose.ollama.yml``
overlay wires ``OLLAMA_BASE_URL`` for the ollama profile; async
``iter_run_events`` handles ``ConnectionClosed`` like sync; README/smoke
comments updated.

No known functional gaps remain beyond explicit non-goals below.

Chat remains session-scoped ``fast_research`` with prior-report memory —
intentional product shape. Explicit non-goals remain below.

## Explicit non-goals

- Vendoring upstream trees as disconnected apps
- Per-user SQLCipher (architecture choice: shared Postgres)
- STORM Streamlit demo (React UI is the product surface)
- Paper-only eval datasets on backup branches (FreshWiki construction)
